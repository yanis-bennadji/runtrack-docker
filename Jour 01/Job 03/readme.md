Now that we have opened the terminal we are gonna look for an image called `pengbai/supermario` using the following command : 

```sh
docker search pengbai/supermario
```

Let's pull it so we can have it on our computer : 

```sh
docker pull pengbai/docker-supermario
```

You will notice after this that it appears on your Images list in Docker Desktop now.

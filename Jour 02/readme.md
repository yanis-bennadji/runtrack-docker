### üì¶ Runtrack Docker Day 01 Job 02

* The goal here is to learn how to work with Docker using this repository :
  
https://github.com/docker/welcome-to-docker

Lets see now step by step how we are gonna do this.

* Start by cloning the repository
  
* Now you should be able to see the repository in VSCode like this :

  Take a look at the different files you have and you should find the `Dockerfile`. The next step is using this file to create an image that we will use with Docker.

  #### üõ†Ô∏è Lets build an image with a Dockerfile

* The first step is to open the VSCode terminal in our repository to make sur we are inside the right folder, our terminal should look like this :

* Now lets build the image in the terminal with this command line :

```sh
docker build -t <name_of_the_image> .
```

In this command the `-t` flag is used to give a name to the image and the `.` at the end specifies the `build` context as the current directory to look for the Dockerfile. In this case I decided to call this image `learn-docker`.

After using this command line you should see this :

(It can take a bit of time to build, in my case it took 94.1s) and if we take a look at our Docker Desktop we can see that image is here :
